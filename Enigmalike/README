A semi-enigma-machine-like cypher that uses 'rotors' to cypher and decypher messages.
It is more unlike the enigma machine than it is alike, the wheels spin one way to
encode, the other to decode, whereas the enigma machine always went forward, and
paired keys. This doesn't pair keys, nor does the cypher travel throught the
rotors and back after hitting a reflector. The wheel positions are setteable, 
and as many wheels as you want can be added for extra 'cypherage'.
